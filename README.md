# Orbiter - a different form of navigation
Orbiter redefines navigation by replacing traditional tabbed interfaces with a dynamic stack of code panes, each representing a focused context—like a module, function, or symbol. You can easily hold Shift to rearrange these panes in the scroll/mini-map area, where each region is color-coded for clarity. As you explore, each action pushes a new layer onto the stack, letting you dive deep into your code without losing your place. When you're done, you simply pop back—no clutter, no window juggling. This model mirrors the way developers naturally think: in a mental call stack.

Tabbed user interfaces disrupt flow by shuffling your context around. Orbiter’s stack model preserves that context, enhancing focus and clarity across projects. Files explicitly searched for are shown in a right-side alternate pane. Orbiter maintains one primary navigation stack, while other panes are reserved for targeted, single-file views.
