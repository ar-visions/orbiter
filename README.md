# Orbiter - a different form of navigation
Orbiter redefines navigation by replacing traditional tabbed interfaces with a dynamic stack of code panes, each representing a focused contextâ€”like a module, function, or symbol  User holds Shift to rearrange these panes in the scroll/mini-map area, where each region is color-coded for clarity. With this design, Orbiter is a bit more in sync with your mental workspace.  AI is us, so our workspace should be a reflection of us.

# Large workflow maintenance for the user?
It's certainly deliberate management, but less than tabbed user-interfaces. The tabbed interface disrupts flow by shuffling your context around into buttons that Inherently move with constant additions.

Not every file you open goes into workspace (unless it's shift-enter or shift-click).  The primary mechanism
is to bring up the file in the alt pane (on the right side by default).  We suppose it's a bit like Xcode
assistant, however you are your own butler here.  You choose what goes there.

# an AI PC attempt
Orbiter is an open source attempt at an AI-PC application that runs on existing PCs.

We run hyperspace modeling to sync the users eyes and voice with the editor.
The words we are looking at (long with the actual word) is given in to LLM queries.
It is to support both local and remote LLM integration into your particular stack.

We create this stack not only because its easier to deal with, but because its used to navigate
for code we are looking for.  So often you ask yourself 'oh where is this code at', and that weight is
to be lifted off you in Orbiter code-nav.
